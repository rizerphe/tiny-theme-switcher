# Tiny theme switcher
A tiny python app that allows me to switch my config between a set of themes (simultaneously GTK, rofi, wallpaper etc.) on-the-fly. Probably won't work with your config unless I decide to make it actually good. TODO: remove this line from the readme if the project is useful to anyone except me
